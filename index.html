            <p>
                This unit will be covering Asynchronous Programming, which is a technique for executing multiple instructions at the same time.
                Nearly every website or program that you have ever used has used this technique to improve wait times and User Experience.
                We have (almost) exclusively programmed so that one line executes immediately after the next, but the tools we'll learn this week, like Callbacks, Promises, and the Async/Await keywords, will help us change that.
